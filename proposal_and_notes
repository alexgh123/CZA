what do we need to do?
	- build our graphs




3 questions:
	what is the time pattern? Is pattern diurnal
	when there is a longer delay from device to gateway, does that impact network latency
	Assuming there is some kind of time-based pattern related to latency, do CDN's have less latency



what is average from:
	each house?
	hourly
		use time stamp
		for record in time band...
		group by
	get average time




scamper
	pings

"different ideas"
	-corey corelation
	-zaki additive effect
	-ping loss, latency
	-correlation among data points
	-diurnal
	-CDNs less diurnal


scamper tool for tracerout
	output to json
	paris style traceroute
	scamper = paralle internet measurement utility
	write json


	cut data a couple of ways

ping, 
increased latency

might expect packet loss for 
	outage
	congestion




1.1  automate data collection to send to github
	- file names per day
	- re start script
	
2.   set up rasbery PIs
3.   set up data analysis pipelines
4.   hammer out what questions we want answered from data
5.

DONE 1. email beverly



next steps:
	traceroute
	buy rasbery PI
	DONE - format output
	add sites that are on/off CDN





fields:
ip, avg_time of 5 pings, tod, 

---- now ----

to handle failure?
	not a failure, i was impatient

------------

to parse input
	grep gateway | cut -d':' -f 2



session 2 below 

limit pings
detect failed pings
how to store pings

zaki thesis:
	1. diurnal for all pings
	2. how does each site's response compare to average
	3. re traceroute, how quickly does our path converge

ping:
	how long it takes to get to service
	IDEAS:
		we xpect CDNs to be faster
		diurnal patern

traceroute
	what is route to get to service
		IDEAS:
			assumptions: our paths will converge
			ZAKI: assumes CDN sites will be w/in one convergence




==============
session 1 below

action items:
	1. zaki will set up rasbery pi
		+ 
	2. ask beverly about "screen" in tcp_dump
	3. why can't we run this in python
	4. pick sites to test
	5. teach git, set up public repo
	6. make sure we're on same page for gateway default 

we are pinging the default gateway router because we want to confirm out network is up. we want to test the service provider's service, not our own network.



my questions:
	our Q: "how reliable are home networks"
	are we qualified to suggest improvments???

review session notes:
	use 'ping' AND 

	    1. ping local gateway, 

	    2. traceroute
	    3. cli spped test

	record when packets sent
	10 min grain (what is meaningful time)
	pings are harmless
	pick a target that isn't part of a CDN
	we need 1 month of running data
?		does this fit with deadlines?

methodology:
	run tcp dump
	write to pcap
?	"screen" to run in background?
		^ run process in background
		^ it will keep processes running if we log out
	use shell script

CS4558 Project Proposal

Project Name: Investigation into residential local area networks (LAN) performance.

Team members: 
Alex Hardt (ahardt@nps.edu)
Corey Lutton (celutton1@nps.edu)
Zaki Rucker (zarucker@nps.edu)

Research Problem: 
How reliable is the typical residential LAN and what can be done to improve its reliability?

Most users have no idea of the uptime or reliability of their residential network. The only time most LAN problems are noticed is when when the user is actually trying to use her network and notices latency or even a complete lack of connectivity. The remedy that users then take is to manually reset each of the devices that are perceived to be impacted in the hopes that will correct the issue. While this can be effective given, the user is reduced to trial and error in correcting LAN issues and does not have any way to isolate and identify problem area(s) in her LAN. The user also does not have any means of tracking LAN performance over time to better understand trends in performance.

Research Methodology: 
In this project, we will collect home network reliability data by implementing a client on a Raspberry Pi computer to send a periodic internet control message protocol (ICMP) request from residential networks over a period of time  (e.g. the course of a month) to a set of content/service providers such as Google, Facebook, and YouTube. 

We will then analyze the packets received from each of the clients to characterize the actual uptime and availability of the residential LANs and suggest ways to improve the residential LAN by increasing uptime and decreasing latency. The analysis will seek to discern differences between the networks and differences between the content/service providers. 

Resources Needed:
3-4 Raspberry PI computers
Access to several residential networks serviced by different internet service providers (e.g. Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T)
